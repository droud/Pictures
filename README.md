# A Simple Picture Collage Screensaver

This screensaver displays pictures (currently JPEG only) from
a folder on your computer in a pleasing format.  It is basically
a digital photo frame on steroids.

So far as I'm aware, nothing else is available for Windows that
does this type of layout and supports multiple monitors.  The
built-in "Photos" screensaver on Windows 7 is decidedly lacking!

## Features

* Works on standard and widescreen monitors
* Multiple layout grid sizes and image spanning
* Handles vertical and horizontal images correctly
* Centers and scales images to avoid black bars
* Unlimited monitors supported without additional tools
* Low memory consumption

## Usage

1. Build the project in release mode (Visual Studio 2010+)
1. Rename the output "Pictures.exe" file to "Pictures.scr"
1. Right click on the "Pictures.scr" file and click "Install"
1. Choose a folder and refresh delay time, then click "Save"

## Future

* Installer
* Automatic grids at standard ratios
* Additional file format support
* Grid and span size choices
* Animated and 3D transitions
* Border size choices
